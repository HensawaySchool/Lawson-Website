        <h2>About The Writer</h2>
        <p>Hello reader! Thank you so much for deciding to research or learn with my website. I had decided to create this website so that I would be able to contribute to the annual Lawson competition.</p>

        <p>My name is Henry Scott, and I am a seventh grader from London, Ontario (Canada). This is my first year doing the Lawson project, but I'm feeling good about it so far. I have grown up moving around a bit, and I have interests in Visual Arts, Science, Astronomy, and Math. I speak both French and English due to being at a French Immersion school.</p>

        <p>If you do not know what Lawson is, it is an annual competition where kids from grades 7 to 8, create a form of media to demonstrate a topic in Canadian history. I decided to do my project about the involvement of Canada during wars for many reasons.</p>

        <p>One of the main reasons I decided to choose the topic I did, was due to the fact my family has a history of war. With this history, comes many different medals and artifacts. These medals were mostly given to my English side of the family.</p>

        <p>Again, thank you for using my website. One more thing, if you are able to; please share this website with your friends and peers with interests of Canadian history or war.</p>

        <h2>Razing of Friesoythe</h2>
        <p>In spring 1945, Canadian Soldiers destroyed Friesoythe, Lower Saxony, and Nazi Germany. They did this due to an order after Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Wigle got killed.</p>
        <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; margin-top: 20px;">
            <img src="https://news.library.mcgill.ca/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/0000-0481.04.260.jpg" alt="Frederick Ernest Wigle" style="width: 200px; margin-right: 20px; border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px;">

            </div>
        </div>
    <p><u>What caused this attack?</u></p>

    <p>On April 14th, 1945, Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick Wigle was killed. He was killed during an invasion that had been taking place in Germany. Due to this death, the soldiers were ordered to destroy all of Friesoythe, Lower Saxony, and Nazi Germany. The man who ordered the soldiers to destroy these places was Christopher Vokes.</p>

    <p><u>Why would he order this?</u></p>

    <p>Christopher Vokes decided to order them to do the act due to the death that happened just before. He took out his anger on the German towns because Frederick W. was shot by one of the bullets a German shot.</p>

    <p><u>What did the soldiers do?</u></p>

    <p>Due to being ordered by their general to destroy Friesoythe, they had been forced to oblige. The soldiers destroyed as much of Friesoythe as they were able to, and with the demolition of this town, came the partial downfall of other German towns with it.</p>

    <p><u>How did they do this?</u></p>

    <p>The Canadian soldiers razed Friesoythe and the other towns by using an assortment of weapons. These weapons had ranged from handheld items like flamethrowers, all the way to explosives. These explosives being not too strong, but still impactful, take explosives like grenades or weak dynamite for example.</p>

    <p>"I told them to level the goddamn place... it was a lesson I felt the civilians of Friesoythe deserved to learn."<span style="color: #90896d;"> - Christopher Vokes, a Canadian general throughout the second World War admitted during an interview.</span></p>

    <p><u>Well, what were the results?</u></p>

    <p>Due to the fact that the soldiers had used weapons of such large variety, the towns ended up a mess. Houses were destroyed, people died, it was one of the most horrible things to happen to the towns. With the attacks, 20 civilians had sadly lost their lives that day.</p>

        <h2>Somalia Affair</h2>
        <p><u>What was it like beforehand?</u></p>
<p>Somalia was experiencing an average day, and there was a current humanitarian mission taking place. The humanitarian mission was being done by Canada, and so far, it had not been going bad. That had been what was going on during the beginning of the mission, but that would not last for too long.</p>

<p><u>Somalia and Humanitarian missions explained;</u></p>
<p>Right now you may be wondering, ‘What is Somalia?’ or ‘Humanitarian mission? What’s that?’ and it is a fair question, for it is important. Due to that, this can help you learn the basics of these topics. We can start off with Somalia, for it is where this event takes place. Somalia is one of the easternmost countries located within the continent of Africa, and relatively, a normal country. Now, a humanitarian mission is when a country goes to a different country; usually with more poverty or more issues, and helps them. Think of it as a peacekeeping mission.</p>

<p><u>What happened that day?</u></p>
<p>On March 16th, 1993, 16 year old Shidane Arone was brutally tortured and killed by Canadian soldiers. Shidane had fallen for a hunger trap set up by the soldiers, and he was taken. After the soldiers had taken him to their spot, they tied him up to immobilise him. Once he was tied up, they started beating him without any reason. After hours of torture and harrassment from these Canadian soldiers, Shidane had finally and sadly lost his life.</p>

<p><u>What were the repercussions?</u></p>
<p>The village clan that Shidane was in was gewarded $15,000 in American dollars. (8553366.00 SOS) due to the crime. After news spread about this act, Canada’s reputation worsened and got damaged. Three of the Canadian soldiers were held responsible and were criminally convicted, with two of the three only having minor charges pressed.</p>
</p>
    </div>

    <div id="page5" class="tab-content">
        <h2>Shidane Arone</h2>
        <p>Shidane Arone was born in Somalia in 1976. He spent his entire life in Somalia, which he considered his home country. He lived with his parents and grew up in a modest environment.</p>

        <p>In March 1993, Shidane was tragically lured and captured by Canadian soldiers. They used food to bait him, exploiting his hunger. Unaware of the danger, Shidane followed them to their base, where his fate would be sealed. At the time, his disappearance had not yet been noticed or reported.</p>

        <p>Once at the base, the Canadian soldiers, who were part of the United Nations’ humanitarian mission in Somalia, immobilized Shidane and began to assault him. They subjected him to relentless torture and harassment. On March 16, 1993, after enduring hours of brutality, Shidane succumbed to his injuries and passed away at the young age of 16.</p>

        <p>Following his death, members of Shidane’s village clan filed a report against the Canadian soldiers. The Canadian government compensated the clan with $15,000 USD. However, Shidane’s parents claimed they never received the compensation. When they took their case to court, the judge dismissed their claims as unsubstantiated, effectively closing the case.</p>

        <p>The news of Shidane’s death spread quickly, drawing widespread attention to the incident. As more people learned about the tragedy, Canada’s international reputation suffered significant damage. Three Canadian soldiers were charged in connection with the incident, but only one faced serious consequences.</p>
